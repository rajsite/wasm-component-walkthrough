  - Should see a prompt to install recommended extensions, go ahead and do that


#### WSL or Linux locally

- Install [Node 22 LTS+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- Clone the repo locally

### Install WASM tooling

- After fetching the repository, in the terminal run `npm run setup-linux`
- Close the terminal and **open a new terminal** so the new cli tools can be found in path
- Verify commands installed with: `wastime --version`

### Build

- In a new terminal window `npm run build` to build all the examples.
